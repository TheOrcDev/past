status: accepted
operator-approval: not-required
plan: 008
requested: 2026-10-12 by Claude for plan 008, slice 6 (room 7, then)

`status` is one of open, delivered, revise, accepted, rejected or cancelled.
`operator-approval` is required or not-required. `plan` names the plan whose
image budget pays for this request.

## Purpose

The past layer of `hospice_on_stilts`, an edit of IMG-0079-v1.

## Generation

`tools/images/run.ts` reads this block.

```json
{
  "model": "codex/gpt-6.1-sol",
  "size": "2560x1440",
  "quality": "high",
  "n": 2,
  "background": "opaque",
  "references": [
    "art-source/raw/IMG-0079/IMG-0079-v1.png"
  ],
  "mask": null
}
```

## Prompt

The tool sends this text block verbatim.

```text
Edit this image in place. Keep exactly the same composition, camera, perspective, horizon and every shape where it stands: the door and the boat outside, the beams, the cots, the herbs, the cabinet, the chart and the stretcher, and the floor. Only change the time and the condition.

Restore the same hospice to how it looked decades earlier, on a busy hopeful afternoon, in full rich warm color, as a painterly gothic matte painting: the cots made up with clean white linen and empty, fresh bunches of green herbs hanging from the rafters, the cabinet full of labelled bottles, the lamps lit, flowers in jars, sunlight through open shutters onto a scrubbed floor, clear water outside. The key light comes from the same direction as in the original.

No people, figures, animals or creatures. No readable text, letters or numbers. No watermark, signature or border.
```
