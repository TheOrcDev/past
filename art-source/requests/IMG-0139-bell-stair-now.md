status: accepted
operator-approval: not-required
plan: 008
requested: 2026-10-12 by Claude for plan 008, slice 8 (room 7)

`status` is one of open, delivered, revise, accepted, rejected or cancelled.
`operator-approval` is required or not-required. `plan` names the plan whose
image budget pays for this request.

## Purpose

Room 7 of chapter 4, `bell_stair` (`docs/story/atlas.md`, `docs/story/ch4-puzzles.md`).

## Generation

`tools/images/run.ts` reads this block.

```json
{
  "model": "codex/gpt-6.1-sol",
  "size": "2560x1440",
  "quality": "high",
  "n": 3,
  "background": "opaque",
  "references": [
    "art-source/raw/IMG-0017/IMG-0017-v3.png",
    "art-source/raw/IMG-0064/IMG-0064-v1.png"
  ],
  "mask": null
}
```

## Prompt

The tool sends this text block verbatim.

```text
Paint a NEW scene (do not copy the reference's layout) in exactly the same monochrome greyscale ink-wash gothic matte-painting style as the reference image: the inside of a tall gothic bell tower with a spiral stone stair at night, seen from eye level, slightly above, for a point-and-click adventure game background.

Composition: A stone spiral stair winds up the inside walls of a square tower; thick bell ropes hang straight down the middle from the darkness above. Narrow lancet windows let in moonlight. A door at the bottom left, the stair rising out of frame at the top right.

The lower third of the image is open, walkable ground: the stone landing at the bottom of the stair runs across the lower third. It is lit by moonlight from lancet windows with drifting fog or haze behind it, so that a black figure standing on it would read clearly. Strong rim light on silhouettes and layered fog, as in the reference. Dark framing only in the top corners and the extreme foreground edges.

No people, figures, animals or creatures. No readable text, letters or numbers anywhere. No watermark, signature or border.
```

## Must have

- The spiral stair, the hanging bell ropes, the door bottom left, the way up top right.

## Must not have

- Figures, readable text, or a frame.

## Acceptance criteria

Claude checks these.

- [ ] It matches the heights' reveal (IMG-0064 v1).
- [ ] Every object the chart names can be a hotspot.
- [ ] Unknown would read against the ground.
