status: accepted
operator-approval: not-required
plan: 008
requested: 2026-10-12 by Claude for plan 008, slice 8 (room 4)

`status` is one of open, delivered, revise, accepted, rejected or cancelled.
`operator-approval` is required or not-required. `plan` names the plan whose
image budget pays for this request.

## Purpose

Room 4 of chapter 4, `dovecote` (`docs/story/atlas.md`, `docs/story/ch4-puzzles.md`).

## Generation

`tools/images/run.ts` reads this block.

```json
{
  "model": "codex/gpt-6.1-sol",
  "size": "2560x1440",
  "quality": "high",
  "n": 3,
  "background": "opaque",
  "references": [
    "art-source/raw/IMG-0064/IMG-0064-v1.png"
  ],
  "mask": null
}
```

## Prompt

The tool sends this text block verbatim.

```text
Paint a NEW scene (do not copy the reference's layout) in exactly the same monochrome greyscale ink-wash gothic matte-painting style as the reference image: a round stone dovecote on a flat stretch of cathedral roof at night, seen from eye level, slightly above, for a point-and-click adventure game background.

Composition: In the centre, a round stone dovecote tower with rows of little arched nest holes, grey doves on every ledge, and one pure white dove. A small door at its base, and a wooden trapdoor in the roof beside it leading down into an attic. On the right, a door into the cathedral's tower. The city below in fog.

The lower third of the image is open, walkable ground: the flat roof around the dovecote runs across the lower third. It is lit by moonlight with drifting fog or haze behind it, so that a black figure standing on it would read clearly. Strong rim light on silhouettes and layered fog, as in the reference. Dark framing only in the top corners and the extreme foreground edges.

No people, figures, animals or creatures. No readable text, letters or numbers anywhere. No watermark, signature or border.
```

## Must have

- The dovecote with grey doves and one white one, its door, the trapdoor, the tower door on the right.

## Must not have

- Figures, readable text, or a frame.

## Acceptance criteria

Claude checks these.

- [ ] It matches the heights' reveal (IMG-0064 v1).
- [ ] Every object the chart names can be a hotspot.
- [ ] Unknown would read against the ground.
