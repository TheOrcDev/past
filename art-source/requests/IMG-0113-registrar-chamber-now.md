status: accepted
operator-approval: not-required
plan: 008
requested: 2026-10-12 by Claude for plan 008, slice 7 (room 10)

`status` is one of open, delivered, revise, accepted, rejected or cancelled.
`operator-approval` is required or not-required. `plan` names the plan whose
image budget pays for this request.

## Purpose

Room 10 of chapter 3, `registrar_chamber` (`docs/story/atlas.md`, `docs/story/ch3-puzzles.md`).

## Generation

`tools/images/run.ts` reads this block.

```json
{
  "model": "codex/gpt-6.1-sol",
  "size": "2560x1440",
  "quality": "high",
  "n": 3,
  "background": "opaque",
  "references": [
    "art-source/raw/IMG-0014/IMG-0014-v2.png",
    "art-source/raw/IMG-0063/IMG-0063-v1.png"
  ],
  "mask": null
}
```

## Prompt

The tool sends this text block verbatim.

```text
Paint a NEW scene (do not copy the reference's layout) in exactly the same monochrome greyscale ink-wash gothic matte-painting style as the reference image: a narrow, orderly clerk's chamber in a gothic records hall at night, seen from eye level, slightly above, for a point-and-click adventure game background.

Composition: A tall standing desk on the left with stacks of papers squared exactly. The back wall is a grid of hundreds of pigeonholes, each with a rolled paper. On the right, a huge round steel vault door with a ring of brass letter dials around a central wheel. A narrow door on the far left.

The lower third of the image is open, walkable ground: the polished floor runs across the lower third. It is lit by a single lamp on the desk and moonlight with drifting fog or haze behind it, so that a black figure standing on it would read clearly. Strong rim light on silhouettes and layered fog, as in the reference. Dark framing only in the top corners and the extreme foreground edges.

No people, figures, animals or creatures. No readable text, letters or numbers anywhere. No watermark, signature or border.
```

## Must have

- The standing desk, the wall of pigeonholes, the round vault door with letter dials on the right, the narrow door on the left.

## Must not have

- Figures, readable text, or a frame.

## Acceptance criteria

Claude checks these.

- [ ] It matches the upper city's reveal (IMG-0063 v1).
- [ ] Every object the chart names can be a hotspot.
- [ ] Unknown would read against the ground.

## Delivery

Written by `tools/images`. Files go to `art-source/raw/<ID>/`, unmodified, with
