status: accepted
operator-approval: not-required
plan: 008
requested: 2026-10-12 by Claude for plan 008, slice 7 (room 11, then)

`status` is one of open, delivered, revise, accepted, rejected or cancelled.
`operator-approval` is required or not-required. `plan` names the plan whose
image budget pays for this request.

## Purpose

The past layer of `ledger_vault`, an edit of IMG-0114-v3.

## Generation

`tools/images/run.ts` reads this block.

```json
{
  "model": "codex/gpt-6.1-sol",
  "size": "2560x1440",
  "quality": "high",
  "n": 2,
  "background": "opaque",
  "references": [
    "art-source/raw/IMG-0114/IMG-0114-v3.png"
  ],
  "mask": null
}
```

## Prompt

The tool sends this text block verbatim.

```text
Edit this image in place. Keep exactly the same composition, camera, perspective, horizon and every shape where it stands: the round chamber, the dome and oculus, the lectern and its step, both doors and the floor. Only change the time and the condition.

Restore the same vault to how it looked decades earlier, when the Ledger lay here, in full rich warm color, as a painterly gothic matte painting: an enormous ancient leather-bound book lying open on the lectern, its pages glowing softly with warm golden light, chains of polished brass holding it, candles in the wall niches, warm light everywhere. The key light comes from the same direction as in the original.

No people, figures, animals or creatures. No readable text, letters or numbers. No watermark, signature or border.
```

| Round | Date (UTC) | Verdict | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 2026-10-12T14:30Z | **accepted: v1** | Claude's pick (#29), reviewed on contact sheets; then-edits checked with `align` (chapter 3: p90 1.10–1.59 px). It is the variant traced and built into the game (`art-source/work/`). |
